 - No dots abstraction. Nodes are rich entities with inputs, outputs and properties.
 - No RaphaÃ«l. Pure html5 canvas based. Will be optimized eventually.
 - Not ugly. Coffee-script used.
 - Structured. Backbone, jQueryUI, requirejs and some other cool stuff are used.

### How to try

 - install `node.js`
 - install coffee-script `npm install coffee-script --global`
 - build with cake `cake build` inside repository root
